In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the ADC16 interrupt configuration is set when configuring the ADC16's conversion channel.

The usercan also set the wakeup source by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate theimplementation of a power mode manager. The callback can be registered to the framework. If a power mode transition happens,the callback will be called and user can do something. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware." toolchain="armgcc" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="demo_apps" path="boards/frdmk64f/demo_apps/power_manager">
